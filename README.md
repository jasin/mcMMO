# mcMMO
mcMMO for Nukkit powered MCPE servers.

This is a port of the popular mcMMO plugin for Spigot.
This repository closely follows mcMMO-DEV, but there is no guarantee that any or all of mcMMO-DEV's features will be implemented.

JAR packages will be released soon as the first of many skills are implemented. Feedback is most welcomed, this is ALPHA software so expect things to not work!
